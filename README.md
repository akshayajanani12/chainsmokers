A simple project to play around with Kotlin

The idea is to add all the fancy modern stuff and make it work with Kotlin.

So far I have:

* Dagger 2. This was a hard one
* RxJava 2. Added but not used (yet)
* ThreeTenAbp. Just for the dates, you know
* Room. Making this work with kotlin was a bit challenging. But now is works really fine.
* Retrofit 2 & okhttp: included, but not used, I don't know why I will use them yet
* Mockito. For this one you also have to have a couple of tricks under your hat

Remember, the objective is not to make sense, but to try as much things as possible in kotlin.

If the stars align and I have the energy to it, I'll maybe write about my findings. Meanwhile, use this project as template or example or whatever you want
